# advent-2021

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Commentary

My language of choice, as for 2020, is Clojure, which I am running in Doom Emacs. 
Clojure is a lisp, it has immutable data, is functional, fast, has an excellent set of
functions and libraries, and the full Java ecosystem is there if required. 
I've also brought my little toolbox of simple utils from 2020 along to save some time.

### Day 1

A little warm-up: calculate a simple difference vector and count the positive
entries in part 1, and then aggregate instead with a moving window in part 2.
For the windowing we have the `partition` function.
