My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Commentary

My language of choice, as for 2020, is Clojure, which I am running in Doom Emacs. 
Clojure is a Lisp, it has immutable data, is very functional, fast, has an excellent set of
built-in and external functions and libraries, and the full Java ecosystem is always there if you need it. 

I've brought my little toolbox of simple utils from 2020 along to save some time. 
I also expect to need some graphs, combinatorics, parsing, and matrix manipulation along the way, so I have the `ubergraph`, `math.combinatorics`, `instaparse`, and `core.matrix` libraries respectively on standby.

### Day 1

A little warm-up: calculate a simple difference vector and count the positive
entries in part 1, and then aggregate instead with a moving window in part 2.
For the windowing we have the `partition` function.

### Day 2

We implement a little state machine to track our position according to a list of instructions.
Once we've parsed the input the transitions themselves are very basic in part 1, and fractionally less so in part 2. 
As my little challenge, I've crammed in a couple more lambda functions rather than creating separate definitions.

### Day 3

This is a problem where an array language like J or APL would have been more elegant than Clojure in filtering rows in a matrix based on most or least common bit values in columns etc. but my J skills are nowhere near up to the task. 
That's something for a long rainy day to crank through.
Here, part 1 was pretty trivial, but part 2 involved some more complicated logic and some sequential filtering to get the answer.
However, like in Day 2, I got to use my favourite `map` and `reduce`; a day without using a `for` loop is a good day.
I refactored my solution a little at the end to make it more attractive but it's still a little clunkier than I'd like it. 

### Day 4

Sometimes in these puzzles you can see a shortcut to solving the problem, in others you just have to grind out the solution. This is one of those. 
Part 1 is pretty tough, or at least the way I did it. The game of bingo is easy enough, but the scoring calculation requires keeping track of a bunch more information that became painful. Also, finding if there is a filled row or column doesn't lend itself to a nifty one-liner. Maybe I just picked the wrong data representation.

I'm really close to the answer in part 2. I can get down to the finding the second-last winning board, but haven't quite got the final one. There is some subtle error in my code that is holding me back. I am putting this one on hold, and maybe I'll come back to it.

### Day 5

Finding overlapping points between different line segments in 2D integer space is a nice little puzzle once you've parsed the input into endpoints. 
I could also leverage some code I used in Advent 2019 to solve Part 1.

For dealing with diagonal lines in part 2, I chose to rewrite the core function with a brute-force approach that although simpler, takes longer. But it gets the answer, even if you have to wait.

### Day 6

At a first pass, this looks simple enough, and part 1 certainly is. Just seed a vector from the input file, and update it against the rules for the given number of days, and count the number of items at the end. Easy. Then you get to part 2 and realise that this function is a slow exponential, and while the number of elements at 80 days is reasonable, the values at 256 days will blow your modest RAM on the _test_ set. After some thinking you realise that there is a better way: you don't need to keep the whole vector, you just need to keep the _counts_ of each value. So I refactored my initial solution to the new approach, and the part 2 answer popped out in a couple of milliseconds on my electronic abacus.
